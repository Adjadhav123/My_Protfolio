# Portfolio Images

Please add the following images to the `/static/images/` directory:

1. **profile.jpg** - Your professional headshot/profile photo (recommended size: 400x400px)
2. **about.jpg** - An additional photo for the about section (recommended size: 600x400px)

## Image Requirements:
- Format: JPG, PNG, or WebP
- Profile image should be square (1:1 aspect ratio)
- About image should be landscape (3:2 aspect ratio)
- High quality but optimized for web (under 500KB each)

## How to add images:
1. Save your photos with the exact names: `profile.jpg` and `about.jpg`
2. Place them in the `static/images/` folder
3. Ensure the names match exactly (case-sensitive)

The website will work without these images, but they will appear as broken image placeholders until you add your actual photos.
